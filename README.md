# Ascending_and_Descending_order_Sorter

📄 Ascending & Descending Order Sorter
🎯 Overview
This C program allows the user to sort a list of integers in ascending order, descending order, or both. It provides a simple menu-driven interface so the user can choose the desired sorting mode and view the results immediately.

✨ Features
✅ Input a custom number of integers
✅ Choose between Ascending, Descending, or Both order sorting
✅ Displays the list before and after sorting for easy comparison
✅ Menu-driven interface allowing multiple runs until the user chooses to exit

🧠 How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the number of integers and then the list of numbers.

2. The program applies a basic comparison-based sort (similar to selection sort) to arrange the numbers.

3. The sorted list is displayed on screen.

📝 Example Interaction:
